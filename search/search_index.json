Claims represent a promise or contract that is made between two parties. The issuing party issues a claim to someone who then holds the claim and has the right to redeem that claim based on the terms specified by the claim issuer. Terms for a claim can be the length of time, amount, or even a custom-written agreement. When a person or entity issues a claim, the \u200b\u200bfulfillment of the claim, even upon redemption and valid terms, is not guaranteed. Any person who issues a claim to someone is held publicly accountable with their integrity and trust, however, they might fail to fulfill the promise made. On the other hand, claims issued by pools that execute verifiable contracts are always guaranteed to resolve successfully, as long as the claim conditions are met, and the pool owns sufficient tokens to resolve the claim. To create a claim, visit the Xeta network app, connect your wallet by clicking on the \u201cconnect\u201d button on the top right and selecting \u201cnew claim\u201d. You will be able to assign an owner for the claim, setting an associated claim token as well as claim amounts. You will be able to specify when the claim should be able to unlock or when it should expire. Most commonly, claims represent tickets for something that you contribute to a pool. For example, you might submit a vote to a voting pool or a bid to an auction pool. Alternatively, you might deposit tokens to a swap-liquidity or staking pool or participate in a lottery pool. In all of these cases, you receive a claim, which enables you to redeem it at a later point in time, based on the pools\u2019 resolution mechanism. Intro Claims represent a promise or contract that is made between two parties. A claim creator issues a claim to someone representing an option that can be redeemed based on specified terms such as timeframe or amount. The claim owner can redeem the claim once the condition of the claim is met. The fulfillment of promises made by claims is not guaranteed and is dependent on the issuers\u2019 integrity and trust. However, if a pool with a verifiable program issues the claim, the claim resolution can be guaranteed through code. Use Cases: Claims between two users (credit claims, ownership claims, contracts, promises) Claims between a pool and a user (liquidity claim, deposit claim, vote claim, lottery ticket claim, etc.) Functionality A claim creator creates a claim based on a specific agreement and issues it to a user who has the right to claim once the conditions are met. Most frequently, pools use claims as a ticket to the user, who can redeem the ticket. Created claims can be updated by the creator at any time until resolution. Claim creators can also mark claims as resolved, at which point the claim becomes settled and cannot be updated any longer. Owned claims can be transferred as long as they are not frozen.

Pools are autonomous programs that execute a set of verifiable instructions. Pools are generic wrappers for tokens and enable decentralized functionalities such as auctions, launches, lending, locks, loots, lotteries, royalties, staking, swaps, and votes. Pools can hold tokens, make transfers, and create claims based on their underlying program logic. In short, pools can do everything you can do with a Xeta wallet, except that pools are verifiable and trustless. To create a pool, visit the Xeta network app, click on connect wallet on the top right and select \u201cnew pool\u201d. There, you will be able to specify a program, a pool token, and configure the details of your pool as required by your selected program.

After you create a token, it will be minted to your address or to the specified owner address if the token is an NFT. For every fungible token, an automatic swap pool is created in the background, which enables any token holder to swap tokens for XETA and vice versa. Intro Tokens are fungible (divisible) or non-fungible assets. Fungible tokens are similar to shares and represent fractional ownership of something.

Xeta achieves this by leveraging serverless compute and storage cloud services while innovating incentive structures and extending the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism for scalability. Introduction We have witnessed a rapid increase in Metaverse, Gaming, and NFT adoption during the recent year. The increased demand brought infrastructural challenges, considering these applications' throughput, fee, and latency requirements. Current solutions such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more recently, Binance Smart Chain have shown to be not viable enough as long-term candidates for these rapidly expanding industries: the transaction confirmation times are too slow, and the fees are too high. These issues originate from the inherently nonoptimal economic incentives layer, which is the most challenging part of adjusting once implemented. Misalignments in incentives are precisely why Bitcoin, Ethereum, or BSC nodes are not willing to charge lower fees or process transactions faster. Xeta is a lightweight and serverless solution that solves the incentive problems by incentivizing validators to compete for speed and fees. Xeta builds on top of available serverless infrastructure services offered by all major cloud providers, leveraging the simplicity, predictability, and (theoretically) infinite scalability of storage and compute. Rather than spending significant portions of time, focus, and development resources on innovating distributed compute and storage, Xeta wants to build upon proven serverless offerings from major cloud providers and decide to focus on what matters most to Xeta's mission: the advancement of Metaverse, Gaming and NFT adoption at the interface level, with the goal to onboard 100 million users. To do that, Xeta provides a lightweight but highly scalable blockchain with native pre-written and extensively tested \"programs\" that asset-pools can use. These programs currently include ten common decentralized finance and gaming functionalities such as auctions, fee delegation, launch pads/fundraising, locking/vesting, loot boxes/drop zones, lottery/airdrops, royalty/assets with native yield, staking, swapping/decentralized trading, and voting. Serverless Architecture We propose a new serverless blockchain architecture that focuses on user benefits such as fast transaction confirmation times, low fees (around $0.001), and theoretically infinite data scalability for the demands of Gaming, Metaverse, and Web 3.0 applications (easily in the TB/PB range) by leveraging serverless cloud services. Xeta's node software can be executed on any machine in theory. However, we see an enormous opportunity in serverless offerings by major cloud providers, which allows tapping into proven, stable, and theoretically infinitely scalable compute and storage services while providing the most demanded benefits to end-users (fast confirmation times, low fees, and integrity/verifiability of transactions). Serverless technologies by common cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud were early in 2019/2020. Today, however, we can label these as fully mature and production-grade choices. Furthermore, many content delivery networks such as Cloudflare and Fastly also provide edge-compute capabilities, which have improved to the point of supporting the demands of high-throughput financial transfers. The level of maturity, the ease of access/setup, and linear cost models are reasons for Xeta to focus exclusively on the serverless stack through offerings by the cloud platforms mentioned above. For compute functionality, this encompasses building on AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Alibaba Function Compute, Cloudflare Workers, and Fastly Compute@Edge. Storage leverages Amazon Quantum Ledger DB, Amazon DynamoDB, Azure CosmosDB, Google Firestore, Alibaba Tablestore, and Cloudflare Workers KV. Xeta aims to eventually allow anyone to run confirmation nodes in just two steps, 1. by providing programmatic API keys from either of these platforms and 2. to subscribe to the transactions mempool (a high throughput topic service responsible for ordering and broadcasting transactions). Hence, we hope to democratize opportunities to run nodes, to provide work for the Xeta network while getting compensated in a way that makes sense economically for individual entities. Scalability Serverless infrastructure can scale depending on the limits of underlying technologies as offered by cloud providers. In Xeta's case, we reached a peak of 80k TPS with our current setup. The storage and compute capabilities are theoretically limitless (practically, limited to node providers' account limits or global limits enforced by cloud providers due to hardware constraints). Most serverless compute offerings can support hundreds of thousands of invocations per second, while storage offerings can store trillions of records at a petabyte-scale. To participate in the validation of transactions on Xeta, one only requires to know about the last confirmed transaction affecting the form/to balance, which means that the minimum requirement for joining as a node is extremely low (there is no need to store the entire ledger nor to keep the state of all balances). Xeta Benefits Sub-second confirmation times for transactions Minimal fees (approx. $0.001 per transaction for simple transfers) Infinite scalability and storage (with linear cost) An adjusted Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism Proof of Audit mechanism for integrity and verifiability of transactions Fee delegation (owners can choose to pay for fees for users' transactions) Pools & programs tailored and optimized for Gaming/Metaverse/Web 3.0 use-cases Native read-only interfaces (APIs, frontends) for clients Permissionless Validation Proof of Audit \"It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.\" Xeta allows any client/node to validate transactions and balances (states) at any given time. With each transaction, Xeta nodes broadcast the resulting state (new to and from balances), representing their vote about the outcome. The updated state offers clients a running balance which provides an easy way to audit transaction histories without knowing about all prior transactions or global balance states. If clients don't trust publishing nodes with transactions (or need to perform audits for their own reasons), they can openly confirm balances as many steps back as they require based on their desired confidence level. The simplest audit that a client can perform is requesting the two prior transactions affecting from/to addresses of the transaction to be verified. Clients can confirm that a certain \"UTXO\" existed and was correctly reflected by the new transaction. This functionality can be performed through a public API and interface provided by Xeta read-only nodes so that anyone can participate and make use of this validation methodology when desired. Blockless Ledger Xeta nodes validate and process every transaction individually, rather than agreeing on the validity of a group of transactions within a block. In practice, this means Xeta is blockless or that every transaction can be treated as a block of one. This allows Xeta to produce a continuous data structure of transactions (public ledger) and states (public balances). The benefit for applications is the easy access of transaction history and state of balances at any given point in time while being able to verify the integrity of each transaction (proof of audit). Xeta Consensus Xeta Byzantine Fault Tolerance Xeta builds on top of the original BFT mechanism proposed by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease and the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) approach proposed by Castro and Liskov. We propose a modified mechanism following four progressive rounds for every transaction: proposal, voting, quorum, synchronization. 1. Proposal Any node automatically becomes a leader if it submits the first confirmation for a transaction (resulting balances and reflected state). N Nodes propose their solution to the coordinator client, which registers the first confirming node as leader/authority for the transaction to be confirmed. 2. Voting All subsequent votes (within the acceptable voting window of 1500ms after the transaction has been broadcasted) confirm the leader's vote or object in case their proposed state differs from the leaders' solution. Once confirmations of all participating nodes arrive or the window of 1500ms expires, the voting is considered complete. 3.1 Quorum (total agreement) Usually, transactions are confirmed without conflicts, meaning all nodes confirm the same states as the leader node. In this case, the transaction fee is distributed to all participating nodes. The leader receives at least 10%, while all other nodes share the fee reminder proportionally. 3.2 Quorum (partial agreement) A transaction is also considered confirmed if the weight of confirmations vs. objections is at least 4/5. The weight of each vote is a function of the staked amount by voting nodes multiplied by a factor for length of operation. The node(s) who objected (with <1/5 weight) are deducted a penalty of 0.1-Objection Weight/500 of their staked amount, which is distributed at synchronization step among the then-majority. 3.3 Quorum (non-agreement) If a vote does not reach 4/5 voting weight, it is considered unconfirmed and is rebroadcasted by the coordinator node so that all nodes can resubmit their votes. The same penalty of 0.1-Objection Weight/500 is applied on every round of rebroadcasting to all nodes who object until an agreement (4/5 majority) is reached. Voting nodes can decide to change their initial vote or drop out (by themselves or when staking requirements fall below minimum). 4. Synchronization After a transaction has been confirmed, it is pushed to all nodes, which might update their ledgers based on the outcome (if they have not voted correctly already, or if they are nodes interested in the partition range of the transaction). If a transaction has amassed a penalty balance (due to objecting nodes), it is distributed to the majority (which could flip during voting/rebroadcasting, so penalties are not distributed at every voting round but only after final confirmation). Validator Staking Requirements Nodes who want to participate in the confirmation of transactions have to stake at least 1,000,000 XETA. Our current fee structure allows approximately 50 nodes to participate economically while financing the underlying infrastructure and making a profit. Xeta BFT Conclusion Xeta BFT incentivizes high throughput, low latency, and energy efficiency (unlike PoW mechanisms). Additionally, it guarantees the finality of transactions after the self-imposed maximum confirmation window of 1500ms closes. Lastly, this mechanism ensures that the network functions under a certain amount of faulty nodes (whether unintentionally by being out of sync with the current state or by their intention to harm the network). Mempool & Nodes Xeta Mempool Double spending is the biggest problem for distributed networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum. A \"double spend\" occurs when transactions arrive in different orders on different nodes. Think about a transaction, sending 10 XETA from wallet A to B, and another transaction sending 10 XETA from wallet A to C. Assuming wallet A has only 10 XETA, one of these two transactions must fail by default. However, hypothetically, if both transactions are submitted to different nodes in different orders, a double spend occurs (assuming nodes don't coordinate between each other - which is precisely what consensus mechanisms are designed to do). The Xeta Mempool is a global pub/sub system for all incoming transactions and is responsible for broadcasting these transactions to all subscribing pools. It provides an agreed-upon ordering for messages, which solves the double-spending problem. Additionally, the Xeta Mempool involves multiple fallback mechanisms to avoid a single point of failure. The current limitations of our implementation are 80k TPS and that no prioritization of transactions is possible. Additionally, transactions cannot be reshuffled or moved ahead by paying a higher fee. These attributes are intentionally waived in favor of efficient one-way sorting with higher throughput. TLDR : The Xeta Mempool is a high throughput pub/sub mechanism that ensures the sorting of transactions by order of arrival and broadcasts them to subscribing nodes that process transactions, vote on transaction outcomes, synchronize their state-ledgers, and submit confirmations. Mempool Subscribers The Xeta Mempool receives all incoming transactions and broadcasts them to subscribing nodes. Nodes can listen selectively based on their requirements and preferences (e.g., nodes might want to listen only to transactions with from-address ranges 1-9a-z and to-address ranges from A-Z). This is a purely illustrative example based on the base58 encoding range of addresses. Nodes subscribe to the Mempool, which broadcasts all incoming transactions sequentially ordered by received-at-timestamp. Messages trigger serverless compute functions, which execute modules and programs (either simple transfer, or pre-programmed functions like auctions, staking, swapping, voting, etc.) and update states of balances. Once nodes complete the computation and state reflection internally, they broadcast the result to the coordinator node and are rewarded a portion of the transaction fee upon success. Node Synchronization Nodes subscribe to the Xeta Mempool to receive incoming transactions and update them locally. Depending on different node types (read-only API node or confirmation node), nodes can participate in receiving all transactions or listen selectively and filter for specific segments. Nodes keep a local ledger and submit confirmations to balance updates they believe are correct (to participate in the transaction fee payout). Additionally, nodes consume confirmed transactions, which allows them to update the resulting to & from states locally without having kept a prior ledger. Nodes keep track of transactions internally via an incrementing number, allowing them to stay in sync and detect missed transactions. In the case of discrepancies between a local index and the one of a last broadcasted transaction, nodes can resync and replay transactions they have missed. TLDR: Xeta provides a single data structure of all records, including all states over time. This allows nodes to sync and validate the integrity of transactions at any point in time without knowledge about prior transactions or the state of balances. Node Types Xeta has four node types: coordinator nodes, validator nodes, storage nodes, audit nodes. Coordinator nodes are mediators over the voting process, which receive votes from validator nodes and submit confirmations/rebroadcast transactions, dependent on different quorum outcomes. Every validator node can become a coordinator node if agreed upon by 4/5th of the majority. Validator nodes subscribe to transactions and store a subset of transactions (depending on their preferences or limitations, e.g., different infrastructure limits imposed by certain cloud providers). Validator nodes then execute the transaction instructions and programs, reflect state locally, and submit the reflected state as their vote. The reward for validator nodes is either 0.9/(N-1)*fee if they confirm the authority/leader node or 10% if they are the first submitting node. Storage nodes subscribe to all transactions and store them on serverless storage offerings for hypothetically infinite scalability. Storage nodes provide clients with the ability to access historical balances/transactions. Audit nodes perform audits of transactions and balances by requesting historical data from storage nodes and confirming balances. Audits can be performed as many transactions back as necessary and required by applications (up to the genesis transaction of each asset). Clients can perform audits in their browsers by requesting the required data from storage nodes. Risks & Attack Vectors 51% Attack Attackers are guaranteed to be penalized a portion of their stake with every false vote they submit as confirmation. Confirming nodes have a staked amount (minimum 1,000,000 XETA) which is weighted by their length of operation. The network is secure as long as honest nodes control the majority of the total voting stake. Sybil Attack Voting weight is calculated based on the staked amount and adjusted by a factor for the length of operation. The length of operation serves as a form of reputation which is impossible to fake. Xeta accounts for vote weight rather than vote counts. Hence, the number of nodes and whether owned by the same entity or different entities do not matter. Spam Attack Attackers could spam the network with valid or invalid transactions, affecting bandwidth (best case) or bandwidth and compute resources of nodes. The Xeta Mempool runs sophisticated load balancing and protection software to ensure maximal throughput of honest transactions while throttling bad actors (or clients sending transactions with false markup leading to frequent invalid transactions). Free-Riding Transaction states are broadcasted only after the confirmation is closed and finalized. Therefore nodes can not rebroadcast existing confirmations to collect fees without providing work. Economics Fee Incentives All confirming nodes receive portions of the transaction fee for every successfully confirmed transaction. The leader (proposer of a transaction) is rewarded 10%, and all other nodes are rewarded 0.9/(N-1). A certain number N exists, which is the number of nodes at which the current static transaction fees provide economic reasons to operate a node. This number is approximately 50. Hence up to 50 nodes could participate economically in the voting process of each transaction. The authority/leader node (first node to confirm a transaction and propose the resulting state) receives at least 10% or 0.9/(N-1)*fee, whichever is larger. This simple but effective fee structure allows incentivization that is meaningful to the user by fostering competition between nodes (speed of confirmation, the truthfulness of confirmations). The proposed reward mechanism solves the collective action problems of currently popular networks, mainly the free-rider problem, which originates from misaligned incentives between nodes and clients. Ethereum incentivization discourages providing infrastructure, hence such a dependence on the heavily subsidized and non-economic Infura. Bitcoin discourages confirmation speed and low fees since volunteers are paying for the network infrastructure. TLDR: Xeta's fee structure incentivizes nodes to behave truthfully while contributing efficient infrastructure to the network. This solves collective action problems as experienced by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Pools & Programs Programs replacing EVM Xeta prioritizes client benefits (most notably confirmation speed and low fees) rather than providing a virtualized compute platform that executes bytecode. Xeta covers major use-case programs such as locking, staking, trading, voting, etc., which find importance in applications for Metaverse, Gaming, and NFTs. Focusing on a few programs rather than providing full EVM capabilities results in faster development and easier testing. Xeta provides a limited number of pre-written programs to creators who are building on top of Xeta. Creators often are not familiar with languages like Solidity and would rather spend time implementing features than writing and testing the underlying smart contracts. Lastly, each of Xeta's pre-written programs goes through extensive testing and becomes more trustworthy with every transaction processed. This is the opposite of Ethereum/BSC, where every smart contract has to be audited with each new deployment due to the possibility of change or error. TLDR: Xeta provides native programs instead of EVM functionality to improve development speed, guarantee ease of access to creators/users, and ultimately, focus on what matters most to Xeta's mission: the adoption of Metaverse/Gaming/NFT applications. Programs Xeta focuses on Gaming and Metaverse applications that frequently require features such as auctions, voting, swapping, and similar. Xeta provides ten in-built programs available as the underlying mechanism when creating a new asset pool. Asset pools are smart contracts that send and receive transactions while executing a set of pre-written instructions tied to an underlying asset. Auction Auctions allow anyone to offer fungible or non-fungible tokens for sale. Bids are handled by the program, and auctions are considered successful when the auction pool has no target, the target is met, or the limit is met (equivalent to an instant purchase at maximum price). Launch Fundraising pools allow creators to raise XETA until a specific target or limit is met. Successful funds distribute portions of the raised amount to the creator and the remainder to the assets' swap pool as liquidity. If a pool rate is set, the fund automatically swaps XETA to asset tokens at that specified rate directly, without the condition of having to meet a fundraising goal. Lending Lending pools allow users to borrow tokens against XETA collateral. Lending pools allow \u201cshort selling\u201d a token or resolving claims without owning the token. At the same time, it enables lenders to earn interest by making their tokens available for borrowers. Lock Locking pools allow asset owners to lock funds for various use-cases, such as delayed payouts and vesting. Loot Loot pools allow NFT creators and games to distribute (drop) new NFTs, items, skins from a collection in a randomized and engaging way. Users can enter for free or for a fee as specified by the pool creator. Entrants receive tickets that have a certain probability of winning a random item from the loot pool. Lottery Promo pools provide an airdrop/lottery mechanism, which can engage users or distribute tokens in a simple and fair way. Users can participate for free or for a fee (specified upon pool creation) and receive tickets with a certain probability to win from the prize pool. Royalty Royalty pools are set up by an asset creator who wishes to reward all or parts of his assets based on a specified daily rate. Currently, this finds application in providing NFTs with yield for holding (royalties). Staking Staking pools allow token creators to reward holders of fungible tokens, depending on lock-up length and amount. For example, a pool creator might specify a certain APY and bonus rate for his pool, deposit reward tokens, and allow users to lock up tokens into the pool who will receive rewards once their lock-up period expires. Swap Swapping pools are pools holding XETA and the pool asset, which can be exchanged one for another. Swap pools are the same functionality that makes popular DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap possible. Vote Voting pools allow users to submit votes given a list of assets/addresses or numbers (prediction markets). Voting can be used for governance (voting for new proposals), for predictions with payouts to the winning voters, or to engage users (a mechanism to vote on any tokenized objects and get paid if the vote was correct after pool expiry). Xeta Reality What is Xeta Reality Xeta Reality is the overarching ecosystem consisting of Xeta (the blockchain) and various apps (mobile app for virtualization and tokenization of people and objects) and dApps (such as NFT marketplaces, DEXs, authenticity, and deduplication for NFTs).

Xeta achieves this by leveraging serverless compute and storage cloud services while innovating incentive structures and extending the Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism for scalability. Introduction We have witnessed a rapid increase in Metaverse, Gaming, and NFT adoption during the recent year. The increased demand brought infrastructural challenges, considering these applications' throughput, fee, and latency requirements. Current solutions such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more recently, Binance Smart Chain have shown to be not viable enough as long-term candidates for these rapidly expanding industries: the transaction confirmation times are too slow, and the fees are too high. These issues originate from the inherently nonoptimal economic incentives layer, which is the most challenging part of adjusting once implemented. Misalignments in incentives are precisely why Bitcoin, Ethereum, or BSC nodes are not willing to charge lower fees or process transactions faster. Xeta is a lightweight and serverless solution that solves the incentive problems by incentivizing validators to compete for speed and fees. Xeta builds on top of available serverless infrastructure services offered by all major cloud providers, leveraging the simplicity, predictability, and (theoretically) infinite scalability of storage and compute. Rather than spending significant portions of time, focus, and development resources on innovating distributed compute and storage, Xeta wants to build upon proven serverless offerings from major cloud providers and decide to focus on what matters most to Xeta's mission: the advancement of Metaverse, Gaming and NFT adoption at the interface level, with the goal to onboard 100 million users. To do that, Xeta provides a lightweight but highly scalable blockchain with native pre-written and extensively tested \"programs\" that asset-pools can use. These programs currently include ten common decentralized finance and gaming functionalities such as auctions, fee delegation, launch pads/fundraising, locking/vesting, loot boxes/drop zones, lottery/airdrops, royalty/assets with native yield, staking, swapping/decentralized trading, and voting. Serverless Architecture We propose a new serverless blockchain architecture that focuses on user benefits such as fast transaction confirmation times, low fees (around $0.001), and theoretically infinite data scalability for the demands of Gaming, Metaverse, and Web 3.0 applications (easily in the TB/PB range) by leveraging serverless cloud services. Xeta's node software can be executed on any machine in theory. However, we see an enormous opportunity in serverless offerings by major cloud providers, which allows tapping into proven, stable, and theoretically infinitely scalable compute and storage services while providing the most demanded benefits to end-users (fast confirmation times, low fees, and integrity/verifiability of transactions). Serverless technologies by common cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Alibaba Cloud were early in 2019/2020. Today, however, we can label these as fully mature and production-grade choices. Furthermore, many content delivery networks such as Cloudflare and Fastly also provide edge-compute capabilities, which have improved to the point of supporting the demands of high-throughput financial transfers. The level of maturity, the ease of access/setup, and linear cost models are reasons for Xeta to focus exclusively on the serverless stack through offerings by the cloud platforms mentioned above. For compute functionality, this encompasses building on AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, Alibaba Function Compute, Cloudflare Workers, and Fastly Compute@Edge. Storage leverages Amazon Quantum Ledger DB, Amazon DynamoDB, Azure CosmosDB, Google Firestore, Alibaba Tablestore, and Cloudflare Workers KV. Xeta aims to eventually allow anyone to run confirmation nodes in just two steps, 1. by providing programmatic API keys from either of these platforms and 2. to subscribe to the transactions mempool (a high throughput topic service responsible for ordering and broadcasting transactions). Hence, we hope to democratize opportunities to run nodes, to provide work for the Xeta network while getting compensated in a way that makes sense economically for individual entities. Scalability Serverless infrastructure can scale depending on the limits of underlying technologies as offered by cloud providers. In Xeta's case, we reached a peak of 80k TPS with our current setup. The storage and compute capabilities are theoretically limitless (practically, limited to node providers' account limits or global limits enforced by cloud providers due to hardware constraints). Most serverless compute offerings can support hundreds of thousands of invocations per second, while storage offerings can store trillions of records at a petabyte-scale. To participate in the validation of transactions on Xeta, one only requires to know about the last confirmed transaction affecting the form/to balance, which means that the minimum requirement for joining as a node is extremely low (there is no need to store the entire ledger nor to keep the state of all balances). Xeta Benefits Sub-second confirmation times for transactions Minimal fees (approx. $0.001 per transaction for simple transfers) Infinite scalability and storage (with linear cost) An adjusted Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism Proof of Audit mechanism for integrity and verifiability of transactions Fee delegation (owners can choose to pay for fees for users' transactions) Pools & programs tailored and optimized for Gaming/Metaverse/Web 3.0 use-cases Native read-only interfaces (APIs, frontends) for clients","title":"Xeta Whitepaper"},{"location":"Other-Resources/whitepaper/#permissionless-validation","text":"Proof of Audit \"It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.\" Xeta allows any client/node to validate transactions and balances (states) at any given time. With each transaction, Xeta nodes broadcast the resulting state (new to and from balances), representing their vote about the outcome. The updated state offers clients a running balance which provides an easy way to audit transaction histories without knowing about all prior transactions or global balance states. If clients don't trust publishing nodes with transactions (or need to perform audits for their own reasons), they can openly confirm balances as many steps back as they require based on their desired confidence level. The simplest audit that a client can perform is requesting the two prior transactions affecting from/to addresses of the transaction to be verified. Clients can confirm that a certain \"UTXO\" existed and was correctly reflected by the new transaction. This functionality can be performed through a public API and interface provided by Xeta read-only nodes so that anyone can participate and make use of this validation methodology when desired. Blockless Ledger Xeta nodes validate and process every transaction individually, rather than agreeing on the validity of a group of transactions within a block. In practice, this means Xeta is blockless or that every transaction can be treated as a block of one. This allows Xeta to produce a continuous data structure of transactions (public ledger) and states (public balances). The benefit for applications is the easy access of transaction history and state of balances at any given point in time while being able to verify the integrity of each transaction (proof of audit).","title":"Permissionless Validation"},{"location":"Other-Resources/whitepaper/#xeta-consensus","text":"Xeta Byzantine Fault Tolerance Xeta builds on top of the original BFT mechanism proposed by Lamport, Shostak, and Pease and the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) approach proposed by Castro and Liskov. We propose a modified mechanism following four progressive rounds for every transaction: proposal, voting, quorum, synchronization. 1. Proposal Any node automatically becomes a leader if it submits the first confirmation for a transaction (resulting balances and reflected state). N Nodes propose their solution to the coordinator client, which registers the first confirming node as leader/authority for the transaction to be confirmed. 2. Voting All subsequent votes (within the acceptable voting window of 1500ms after the transaction has been broadcasted) confirm the leader's vote or object in case their proposed state differs from the leaders' solution. Once confirmations of all participating nodes arrive or the window of 1500ms expires, the voting is considered complete. 3.1 Quorum (total agreement) Usually, transactions are confirmed without conflicts, meaning all nodes confirm the same states as the leader node. In this case, the transaction fee is distributed to all participating nodes. The leader receives at least 10%, while all other nodes share the fee reminder proportionally. 3.2 Quorum (partial agreement) A transaction is also considered confirmed if the weight of confirmations vs. objections is at least 4/5. The weight of each vote is a function of the staked amount by voting nodes multiplied by a factor for length of operation. The node(s) who objected (with <1/5 weight) are deducted a penalty of 0.1-Objection Weight/500 of their staked amount, which is distributed at synchronization step among the then-majority. 3.3 Quorum (non-agreement) If a vote does not reach 4/5 voting weight, it is considered unconfirmed and is rebroadcasted by the coordinator node so that all nodes can resubmit their votes. The same penalty of 0.1-Objection Weight/500 is applied on every round of rebroadcasting to all nodes who object until an agreement (4/5 majority) is reached. Voting nodes can decide to change their initial vote or drop out (by themselves or when staking requirements fall below minimum). 4. Synchronization After a transaction has been confirmed, it is pushed to all nodes, which might update their ledgers based on the outcome (if they have not voted correctly already, or if they are nodes interested in the partition range of the transaction). If a transaction has amassed a penalty balance (due to objecting nodes), it is distributed to the majority (which could flip during voting/rebroadcasting, so penalties are not distributed at every voting round but only after final confirmation). Validator Staking Requirements Nodes who want to participate in the confirmation of transactions have to stake at least 1,000,000 XETA. Our current fee structure allows approximately 50 nodes to participate economically while financing the underlying infrastructure and making a profit.

TLDR: Xeta provides native programs instead of EVM functionality to improve development speed, guarantee ease of access to creators/users, and ultimately, focus on what matters most to Xeta's mission: the adoption of Metaverse/Gaming/NFT applications. Programs Xeta focuses on Gaming and Metaverse applications that frequently require features such as auctions, voting, swapping, and similar. Xeta provides ten in-built programs available as the underlying mechanism when creating a new asset pool. Asset pools are smart contracts that send and receive transactions while executing a set of pre-written instructions tied to an underlying asset. Auction Auctions allow anyone to offer fungible or non-fungible tokens for sale. Bids are handled by the program, and auctions are considered successful when the auction pool has no target, the target is met, or the limit is met (equivalent to an instant purchase at maximum price). Launch Fundraising pools allow creators to raise XETA until a specific target or limit is met. Successful funds distribute portions of the raised amount to the creator and the remainder to the assets' swap pool as liquidity. If a pool rate is set, the fund automatically swaps XETA to asset tokens at that specified rate directly, without the condition of having to meet a fundraising goal. Lending Lending pools allow users to borrow tokens against XETA collateral. Lending pools allow \u201cshort selling\u201d a token or resolving claims without owning the token. At the same time, it enables lenders to earn interest by making their tokens available for borrowers. Lock Locking pools allow asset owners to lock funds for various use-cases, such as delayed payouts and vesting. Loot Loot pools allow NFT creators and games to distribute (drop) new NFTs, items, skins from a collection in a randomized and engaging way. Users can enter for free or for a fee as specified by the pool creator. Entrants receive tickets that have a certain probability of winning a random item from the loot pool. Lottery Promo pools provide an airdrop/lottery mechanism, which can engage users or distribute tokens in a simple and fair way. Users can participate for free or for a fee (specified upon pool creation) and receive tickets with a certain probability to win from the prize pool. Royalty Royalty pools are set up by an asset creator who wishes to reward all or parts of his assets based on a specified daily rate. Currently, this finds application in providing NFTs with yield for holding (royalties). Staking Staking pools allow token creators to reward holders of fungible tokens, depending on lock-up length and amount. For example, a pool creator might specify a certain APY and bonus rate for his pool, deposit reward tokens, and allow users to lock up tokens into the pool who will receive rewards once their lock-up period expires. Swap Swapping pools are pools holding XETA and the pool asset, which can be exchanged one for another. Swap pools are the same functionality that makes popular DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap possible. Vote Voting pools allow users to submit votes given a list of assets/addresses or numbers (prediction markets). Voting can be used for governance (voting for new proposals), for predictions with payouts to the winning voters, or to engage users (a mechanism to vote on any tokenized objects and get paid if the vote was correct after pool expiry).","title":"Pools &amp; Programs"},{"location":"Other-Resources/whitepaper/#xeta-reality","text":"What is Xeta Reality Xeta Reality is the overarching ecosystem consisting of Xeta (the blockchain) and various apps (mobile app for virtualization and tokenization of people and objects) and dApps (such as NFT marketplaces, DEXs, authenticity, and deduplication for NFTs).

The steps can be roughly outlined into creating a wallet, getting XETA tokens, creating NFTs, creating a collection profile, creating auctions, and promoting your collection. Connect a Wallet To get started, you need a wallet so that you can hold XETA tokens and NFTs. Navigate to the Xeta network app and click on \u201cconnect\u201d in the top right corner. You will be able to choose between two options, a managed and a self-managed wallet. The easier of these two is the managed wallet, which you can use by entering an account username and secret password. If you already have a wallet, connect your wallet by importing your private key or signing in with your account details. Getting XETA Tokens Once you\u2019ve connected your wallet, visit the Xeta network homepage to get free tokens from the faucet feature. Alternatively, you can ask for a creators\u2019 grant on the Xeta website, buy XETA tokens from an exchange, or swap Ether and BNB using the bridge feature on the Xeta network homepage. Creating NFTs Once you own some XETA tokens to pay for network fees, you can begin creating your NFTs. Simply click on your wallet in the top right corner, and select \u201cnew token\u201d. Enter your token name, upload the token image under the preview field, and set additional details such as description and links. Other fields are not necessary unless you want to link an object, assign it to someone, or customize your NFT metadata. Once you\u2019ve filled in your token details, submit the transaction, and you will find your new NFT in your wallet. Repeat the token creation process for every NFT that you want to create. Creating a Collection Profile You can find your minted tokens by clicking on your wallet in the top right, then on \u201cview address,\u201d and navigating to the tokens tab. On your address page, you can customize your profile to represent your new NFT collection. Click on update profile and add details about your collection, such as name, description, links, and a preview image. Creating Auctions Once you\u2019ve created NFTs and a creator profile, you are ready to sell your NFTs. Click on your wallet and select \u201cnew pool\u201d. Pools are programs such as auctions that handle transfers and tokens for you. Select auction as the program, and set the token value to the NFT that you would like to sell. Give your auction pool a name and set an expiration date. Finally, add a XETA target amount representing the minimum amount that you would like to sell the NFT for and a XETA limit amount, which is the maximum amount and equivalent to the instant-buy bid. You can also leave the limit amount empty if you want to create an open-ended auction that completes after the expiration date. Submit the transaction and repeat this step for all your NFTs that you want to sell. Once you\u2019ve created auction pools for your NFTs, you need to deposit the NFTs. The bidding opens once you deposit. To view your completed auctions, navigate to your wallet and click on \u201cview address\u201d under wallet actions. Open the pools tab, where you will find all your created auction pools. Open them one by one, and click the dropdown on the right to deposit your NFT. Promoting your Collection Share your auctions on social media, and let people know about your new Xeta NFT collection. Additionally, you might want to create a lottery for one of your NFTs. Lotteries are very useful to raise awareness about your project and have new participants discover it. Finally, you could offer royalties for all NFT holders, which presents an excellent incentive for potential buyers.

To start, let\u2019s see why and when you might want to use a pool. Pools enable trustless execution of code through prewritten programs. When you deal with another party, trust plays an essential part in the transaction. With pools, you can simply trust that the program will execute the code instead of relying on human integrity. There are ten prewritten programs on Xeta, which have been extensively tested and verified. Let\u2019s look at each pool program and explain what they are used for. Auction programs enable creators to sell their NFT. Users submit bids to the auction pool, and upon completion, the pool automatically transfers the assets to the individual parties depending on the success of the auction. Launch programs enable projects to raise funds by distributing tokens to participants who wish to contribute XETA tokens. The XETA contribution is added to the liquidity of the launched token and can be traded afterward through its swap pool. Participants in the launch can claim their share of tokens after the launch completes. Lending programs enable the lending and borrowing of fungible tokens. Lenders can deposit tokens to earn interest, and borrowers can borrow tokens in exchange for XETA collateral. Lock programs enable users to lock tokens for themselves, or for someone else. This might come in handy when a project wants to distribute tokens without making them available instantly. Loot programs are dropzones, where NFT creators can launch and distribute their NFTs in a randomized way. Creators specify a win probability, and users can transfer the required participation amount to the loot pool. Every transfer has a chance to win a random NFT, dependent on the loot pool probability. Lottery programs enable creators to run promotions for a prize, which can be a fungible token or an NFT. Users enter a lottery for free or for the minimum required contribution amount and receive a participation ticket otherwise known as a claim. Once the lottery completes, users can redeem their claim to see if they hold a winning ticket and receive their part of the prize. Royalty pools allow users to earn passive income by holding NFTs. Creators of NFTs can set up a royalty pool and deposit reward tokens to it. Royalties accumulate day by day and can be claimed by holders of eligible NFTs, which are specified by the creator. Staking programs enable token creators to offer rewards for locking tokens for a certain amount of time. Users can stake tokens, and receive interest as well as bonus tokens in return once their staking period expires. Swap programs are simply decentralized exchanges operating through a mathematical swap function. After liquidity is added to a swap pool, users can swap XETA into tokens or vice versa in a fully trustless and open way. Vote programs enable voting on numeric targets like budgets, prediction markets, or a predefined set of candidates. Furthermore, vote programs can create betting games that reward voters with the correct answer. To create a pool, visit the Xeta network app and connect your wallet. Click on your wallet, and select \u201cnew pool\u201d under your wallet actions. Specify the associated pool token as well as the program.

Lottery Promo pools provide an airdrop/lottery mechanism, which can engage users or distribute tokens in a simple and fair way. Users can participate for free or for a fee (specified upon pool creation) and receive tickets with a certain probability to win from the prize pool. Royalty Royalty pools are set up by an asset creator who wishes to reward all or parts of his assets based on a specified daily rate. Currently, this finds application in providing NFTs with yield for holding (royalties). Staking Staking pools allow token creators to reward holders of fungible tokens, depending on lock-up length and amount. For example, a pool creator might specify a certain APY and bonus rate for his pool, deposit reward tokens, and allow users to lock up tokens into the pool who will receive rewards once their lock-up period expires. Swap Swapping pools are pools holding XETA and the pool asset, which can be exchanged one for another. Swap pools are the same functionality that makes popular DEXs like Uniswap or PancakeSwap possible. Vote Voting pools allow users to submit votes given a list of assets/addresses or numbers (prediction markets). Voting can be used for governance (voting for new proposals), for predictions with payouts to the winning voters, or to engage users (a mechanism to vote on any tokenized objects and get paid if the vote was correct after pool expiry).","title":"Xeta Program Overview"},{"location":"Verified-Programs/#xeta-program-overview","text":"Xeta focuses on gaming and metaverse applications that commonly require features such as auctions, voting, swapping.

An auction is a program that enables NFT owners to create an auction for their NFT. Once the NFT auction is created, other users can bid on the NFT or buy it instantly at the limit price. An auction is considered successful if the target bid is reached at expiry. Successful auctions transfer the NFT to the highest bidder and the funds to the auction creator, and vice versa for unsuccessful auctions. To create an auction, visit the Xeta network app and click on \u201cconnect wallet\u201d in the top right corner. Click on your wallet and select \u201cnew pool\u201d under wallet actions. You will be able to specify the program and choose the NFT that you want to sell. Furthermore, you can add Xeta target and limit values and set an expiration date. Once an auction pool is created, the creator must deposit the associated NFT to it. Any other user can then bid on the NFT, as long as the bid is higher than the previous highest bid. To bid on an auction, visit the auction pool and click on \u201cbid\u201d, and enter a XETA amount for your desired bid. You will receive the NFT from the auction pool after expiry if you remain the highest bidder or if your bid is the limit bid, or you will receive back your XETA if someone outbids you. Intro Auctions allow users to offer non-fungible tokens for sale. Participants can submit XETA-bids until the auction expires or the XETA limit is reached. Auction programs automatically handle the resolution by transferring the highest bid and NFT to their new or previous owners (depending on the auction status). Use Cases: Auctioning an NFT that a user owns in exchange for XETA Functionality The NFT owner creates an auction pool and sets a XETA target (minimum bid to consider the auction successful), a limit value (instant-buy bid), and a time of expiration. The NFT owner then deposits the NFT to the auction pool, and participants can place bids to the auction pool. When a participant places a bid higher than the previous bid, the pool automatically returns the earlier bid to the previous leader. The auction outcome is determined when the auction expires or when the limit bid is reached before the expiration time. An auction is considered successful when the limit bid is reached before expiration, or when the target bid is reached at the time of expiration. Auction pools charge a commission of 2.5% for every concluded auction. Upon success/failure of the auction, any Xeta user can call the resolve/cancel method of the auction pool, which then handles the asset transfers to the new or old owners. On auction failure (target bid not reached on expiry), the NFT is returned to the pool creator, and the highest bid is returned to the highest bidder.

Afterward, users can claim the project tokens if the launch was successful, or their initial XETA contribution if the launch didn\u2019t reach the minimum fundraising target. To participate in a launch, visit the launch pool on the Xeta network app and click on \u201cparticipate\u201d. You will be able to specify a XETA amount that you would like to contribute, in exchange for tokens that the pool promotes.

Keep in mind that half of the launch tokens are allocated for participants, while the other half is allocated for the swap pool liquidity of the associated token. Intro Launch pools allow creators to raise funds for a project by offering fungible tokens representing the project in exchange for XETA. Launch pools have a fixed rate of raising funds and a target (minimum) and limit (maximum) XETA amount. A successful launch pool (target amount reached before closure/expiry) automatically handles the liquidity deposit to the fungible token swap pool. Anyone who participated in the launch pool can then claim fungible tokens or recover their initial contribution if the launch didn\u2019t raise the target amount. Use Case: Raise funds for a project and automatically distribute raised funds to liquidity and/or creators. Functionality A fungible-token owner creates a launch pool for a fungible token and shares it with users who can participate by contributing XETA tokens. Pool creators can decide how many tokens they want to offer and how much they want to raise as a minimum and maximum amount. Once a launch expires or closes, participants can claim back either tokens (upon success) or their XETA contribution (upon failure).

To borrow tokens, visit the lending pool on the Xeta network app, connect your wallet and click on borrow. You will be prompted to specify a collateralization value, depending on the minimum collateralization required by the pool. This value determines the amount of tokens that you will receive in return for the XETA amount that you specify. You can keep borrowed tokens indefinitely as long as your collateralization remains above 75% of the minimum. You can return your tokens using the same lending pool that you\u2019ve borrowed from while being charged an interest rate based on the borrowed duration. In case your collateralization drops below 75% of the pools\u2019 minimum, other users can liquidate your lending claim, and your XETA collateral will be used to cover open interest, penalty fees, and the borrowed token amount.

Voting pools enable users to vote on a numeric outcome such as budgets and prediction markets, or on candidates, based on a predefined list of choices. Answer-based vote pools can resolve in multiple ways and reward the creator, the top candidate, the voters who voted correctly, or the voters of an answer that was set through an oracle. Rewarding voters of the most voted answer or the answer as set by an oracle, allows voting pools to be used as betting games with reward functionality. To submit a vote, visit the vote pool page, connect your wallet and click on vote. You will be able to specify a number or answer that you would like to vote on, as well as an amount to add weight to your vote. If the voting mechanism is set to reward voters, voters can claim rewards after the voting pool resolves. To create a vote, connect your wallet and click on \u201cnew pool\u201d under wallet actions. You will be able to specify a list of candidates to create a choice-based vote, as well as the mechanism of resolution after the vote expires. Intro The voting pool allows participants to vote on a numeric outcome (such as bets, estimations, budgets, prediction markets) or on an outcome based on provided answers. Voting pools can require a contribution amount, which serves as a weight for the vote. Vote pools can be resolved using various mechanisms: transferring all collected tokens to the creator, the highest candidate, or the voters (by the highest voted answer or through oracle result). Use Cases: Voting on a numeric outcome (bets, estimations, budgets, prediction markets) Voting on an answer outcome (guesses, candidates, tokens, proposals) Voting by collecting funds and rewarding the vote pool creator Voting by collecting funds and rewarding the highest voted candidate Voting by collecting funds and rewarding voters of the highest voted answer Voting by collecting funds and rewarding voters of the correct answer, as determined by an oracle Functionality A creator creates a voting pool and specifies the participation token, resolution mechanism, and optional candidates. Optionally, a minimum/maximum participation amount can be specified. Voters can then vote by providing a numerical answer (if the voting pool is a numerical vote) or by providing one of the specified answer candidates. Every vote can be weighted by the XETA participation amount. After the vote expires, it can be resolved based on the specified resolution mechanism. The mechanism rewards the creator, candidates or voters of the highest voted answer or the correct answer as determined by an oracle. If the mechanism rewards voters of the highest or correct answer, they can claim their rewards proportional to their weighted vote. Methods Transfer Participate in the voting pool by providing a numerical answer or a candidate from the available choices. Requirements: None Outputs: Transfer claim from pool to sender Inputs: Amount - XETA amount to add weight to the vote Answer - Choice from available candidates Number - Number if the vote is numerical Claim Allows claiming rewards, proportional to the weighted vote divided by the total weight of the winning vote. Requirements: Claim with valid answer Outputs: Reward transfer from pool to sender Inputs: Claim - Claim hash Resolve Resolves vote using the specified vote-pool mechanism. Pays collected XETA weight amounts to either creator, top candidate or enables voters of the highest answer to claim their rewards.
