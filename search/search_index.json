Xeta Reality is a project focused on enabling dApps, gaming and metaverse use-cases using blockchain, AI vision and 3D graphics. Currently Working On: Xeta Blockchain - A high-throughput, low-cost, lightweight blockchain for metaverse and gaming applications More About Xeta Blockchain General Focus Areas Xeta Reality is focused on promoting Gaming and Metaverse adoption using blockchains (think asset registry, virtualization, dApps) and vision AI (object detection/segmentation). The 6 core pillars of Xeta Reality are: 1. Scanning and virtualization of things : Simplifying asset virtualization by building 3D scanning tools/apps to empower anyone to digitize anything anywhere. Extensive research & development of object detection/segmentation AI models. 2. Interoperability between blockchains and realities : Enabling the exchange of fungible and non-fungible assets between common blockchains and parallel realities (physical reality, virtual worlds, omniverses). 3. Asset registry, tokenization and authenticity : Building a L1 blockchain to simplify asset registry and tokenization of things. Integrating identity, deduplication and IP-protection middleware, specifically for NFTs and virtual items (image, video, audio). 4. Virtual economies (DEXs, NFT marketplaces, auctions) : Creation of exchanges & marketplaces for tokens, NFTs, avatars, skins, virtual properties and virtual ad space. Provisioning \"one-click-setup\" DEXs and marketplaces using no-code interfaces. 5. dApp ecosystem (identity, staking, 3rd party) : Providing core functionality dApps (for identity, staking, etc) using Xeta Blockchain and setting up a grant-based incentive program for 3rd party developers. 6. Community, contributors & partnerships : Building and maintaining an active community of ambassadors, providing well documented software to contributors and seeking partnerships with companies for collaboration around Metaverse technologies.","title":"Xeta Reality Overview"},{"location":"#xeta-reality-overview","text":"","title":"Xeta Reality Overview"},{"location":"#quicklinks","text":"Xeta Blockchain Pools & Programs Launch Your Project on XETA About Xeta","title":"Quicklinks"},{"location":"#what-is-xeta-reality","text":"Xeta Reality is a project focused on enabling dApps, gaming and metaverse use-cases using blockchain, AI vision and 3D graphics.","title":"What is Xeta Reality?"},{"location":"#currently-working-on","text":"Xeta Blockchain - A high-throughput, low-cost, lightweight blockchain for metaverse and gaming applications More About Xeta Blockchain","title":"Currently Working On:"},{"location":"#general-focus-areas","text":"Xeta Reality is focused on promoting Gaming and Metaverse adoption using blockchains (think asset registry, virtualization, dApps) and vision AI (object detection/segmentation).

With Xeta Core, we provide these 9 in-built programs, which can be specified as program when creating a new pool: Auctions Auctions allow anyone to offer fungible or non-fungible tokens for sale. Bids are handled by the program and auctions are considered successful when the auction pool has no target, the target is met, or the limit is met (which is equivalent to an instant purchase at maximum price) Fee Delegation Fee delegation pools are holding XETA tokens which can be used for transaction fee reimbursements, when users are transacting with that specific asset (think: fee-less voting, fee-less trading, fee-less participation in airdrops). The intention behind fee delegation is to avoid passing off costs to end users (which is not always wanted). Fund Raising Fundraising pools allow creators to raise XETA until a certain target or limit is met. Successful funds distribute portions of the raised amount to the creator, and the remainder to the assets own swap-pool as liquidity. If a rate is set, the fund automatically swaps XETA to asset tokens at the specified rate directly, without the delay or condition of having to meet a fundraising goal. Loot Loot pools allow NFT creators and games (think skins) to distribute (drop) new items from the collection in a randomized and engaging way. Users can enter (for free or for a fee as specified by the pool creator) and receive tickets which have a certain probability to win a random item from the loot pool. Locking Locking pools allow asset creators to lock funds for various use-cases, such as delayed payouts and vesting. Lottery Promo pools provide an airdrop/lottery mechanism, which can be used to engage users or to distribute tokens in a simple and fair way. Staking Staking pools allow token creators to provide a reward for holders, depending on lock-up length and amount. For example, a pool creator might specify a certain APY for his pool, provide reward tokens, and allow users to lock-up tokens into the pool who then will receive rewards once their lock-up period expires. Swapping Swapping pools are pools holding XETA and the pool-asset, which can then be swapped. Swap pools are classical DEXes, like Uniswap or Pancakeswap. Voting Voting pools allow users to submit votes given a list of assets/addresses, or numbers (prediction markets). Voting can be used for governance (voting for new proposals), for predictions with payouts to the winning voters, or as way to engage users (mechanism to vote on any tokenized object, and get paid if the vote was correct after resolution).","title":"Pools & Programs"},{"location":"pools-programs/#pools-programs","text":"Xeta focuses on gaming and metaverse applications that commonly require features such as auctions, voting, swapping.
