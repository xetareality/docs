# Pools & Programs

Xeta focuses on gaming and metaverse applications that commonly require features such as auctions, voting, swapping. With Xeta Core, we provide these 9 in-built programs, which can be specified as program when creating a new pool:

#### Auctions
Auctions allow anyone to offer fungible or non-fungible tokens for sale. Bids are handled by the program and auctions are considered successful when the auction pool has no target, the target is met, or the limit is met (which is equivalent to an instant purchase at maximum price)

#### Fee Delegation
Fee delegation pools are holding XETA tokens which can be used for transaction fee reimbursements, when users are transacting with that specific asset (think: fee-less voting, fee-less trading, fee-less participation in airdrops). The intention behind fee delegation is to avoid passing off costs to end users (which is not always wanted).

#### Fund Raising
Fundraising pools allow creators to raise XETA until a certain target or limit is met. Successful funds distribute portions of the raised amount to the creator, and the remainder to the assets own swap-pool as liquidity. If a rate is set, the fund automatically swaps XETA to asset tokens at the specified rate directly, without the delay or condition of having to meet a fundraising goal.

#### Loot
Loot pools allow NFT creators and games (think skins) to distribute (drop) new items from the collection in a randomized and engaging way. Users can enter (for free or for a fee as specified by the pool creator) and receive tickets which have a certain probability to win a random item from the loot pool.

#### Locking
Locking pools allow asset creators to lock funds for various use-cases, such as delayed payouts and vesting.

#### Lottery
Promo pools provide an airdrop/lottery mechanism, which can be used to engage users or to distribute tokens in a simple and fair way.

#### Staking
Staking pools allow token creators to provide a reward for holders, depending on lock-up length and amount. For example, a pool creator might specify a certain APY for his pool, provide reward tokens, and allow users to lock-up tokens into the pool who then will receive rewards once their lock-up period expires.

#### Swapping
Swapping pools are pools holding XETA and the pool-asset, which can then be swapped. Swap pools are classical DEXes, like Uniswap or Pancakeswap.

#### Voting
Voting pools allow users to submit votes given a list of assets/addresses, or numbers (prediction markets). Voting can be used for governance (voting for new proposals), for predictions with payouts to the winning voters, or as way to engage users (mechanism to vote on any tokenized object, and get paid if the vote was correct after resolution).
