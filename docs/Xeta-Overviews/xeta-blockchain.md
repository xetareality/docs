# Xeta Blockchain

## Video
The Xeta Blockchain is a serverless blockchain for NFT, Gaming, and Metaverse applications. Xeta is a lightweight blockchain building on top of the serverless infrastructures of cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Alibaba Cloud, and others. This cutting-edge infrastructure enables Xeta to achieve up to 80000 TPS, transaction finality in under one second, and fees as low as a tenth of a cent.

The Xeta blockchain was built with speed, scalability, and user benefits in mind. Poor incentive structures between validator nodes and users are the reason why established blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum are encountering limits in terms of speed and cost. Xeta solves this problem by innovating with a novel consensus mechanism, improving incentives for nodes to compete for efficiency, and leveraging high-performance serverless infrastructure.
