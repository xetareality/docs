# Swap

## Intro
Swap pools are automatically created for every fungible token that is minted. These allow participants to swap tokens against XETA and vice versa in a decentralized way. The price is based on the liquidity that token creators and participants can contribute, and the trades that affect the liquidity.

*Use Case: Decentralized exchange mechanism for fungible tokens*

## Functionality
A swap pool is automatically created with the creation of every fungible token. Creators can add liquidity via a launch pool, or directly by depositing the pool tokens and XETA. The amount of deposited liquidity determines the price, which is determined by dividing the number of tokens available as liquidity by the amount of XETA available as liquidity. Participants can swap XETA for tokens or tokens for XETA. Transfers in and out are entirely handled by the program in an automated way, charging 0.25% commission on every trade and automatically adding 1% of the trade value to the poolsâ€™ liquidity.
