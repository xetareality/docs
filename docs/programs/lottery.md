## Intro
Lottery pools allow the distribution of fungible or non-fungible tokens in a randomized way. Lotteries can be based on specific criteria, such as a minimum token amount that someone must hold to participate or require a minimum amount to enter. After a lottery expires, it can be resolved to automatically distribute the NFT or make the fungible tokens claimable for winning participants.

*Use Cases:  
Distributing an NFT through a randomized mechanism and a single winner  
Distributing fungible-tokens through a randomized mechanism*

## Functionality
A lottery pool can promote a fungible or single non-fungible token to participants, who can enter to win with a probability dependent on the number of entries. After creating the lottery pool, the creator must deposit the fungible tokens or a single NFT. Once the deposit is complete, any user can participate, either for free or the minimum amount required by the pool. Furthermore, pools can set a minimum amount of tokens or XETA that a user needs to hold to be eligible to participate. Requiring a minimum amount of tokens or XETA to participate improves incentives for users to remain honest while being real supporters of a project.

After the lottery pool expires, the resolution call automatically transfers the NFT to a single winner chosen from all participants. If the lottery is promoting a fungible token, winners (based on the poolsâ€™ probability) can claim their fungible-token rewards using their claimable ticket.
