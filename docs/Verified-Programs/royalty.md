# Royalty

## Video
So, what is a royalty program on Xeta? Royalty programs enable NFT holders to earn passive income by claiming royalties from it. Creators set up a pool with token rewards for all or a subset of NFTs, and any user holding an eligible NFT can claim royalties simply for holding the NFT.

To claim royalties, visit the royalty pool page, connect your wallet and click on “claim”. You will automatically receive a payout from the pool, as long as you hold an NFT that is eligible. Rewards accumulate day by day, and you receive daily rewards that have accumulated since your last claim date.

To create a royalty pool and reward NFT holders with passive income, visit the Xeta network app, connect your wallet and click on “new pool” under wallet actions. You will be able to specify the associated reward token as well as a daily reward rate. Once the pool has been created, you can deposit reward tokens to it, so that other users can claim these tokens as royalties.

## Intro
Royalty pools allow NFT creators to allocate a particular token for royalty payouts of NFT holders. Anyone who owns an NFT specified by a royalty pool can claim royalties based on the holding duration.

*Use Cases:  
Reward NFT holders based on the length of holding a certain NFT
Pay a passive income/royalties for anything in the physical or virtual reality, represented by an NFT*

## Functionality
A creator creates a royalty pool and specifies candidates and a linear pay-out rate of rewards. After depositing rewards, any owner of NFTs created by the creator (and as determined by the royalty pool) can then periodically claim royalties from the pool. Royalties accumulate every day until a claim is made (claims reset the daily counter).
