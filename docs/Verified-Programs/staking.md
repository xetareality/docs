# Staking

## Video
So, what is the staking program on Xeta? Staking enables users to commit tokens for a specified duration of time, and earn rewards based on the staking interest and bonus rate.

To participate in a staking pool, visit the pool page, connect your wallet and click on “stake”. You will be required to enter your desired amount as well as the lock duration. The pool issues a claim to you, which you can redeem once your lock period expires. You will receive your initial contribution, including interest and bonuses accumulated depending on your selected staking duration.

To create a staking pool for a token, connect your wallet and click on “new pool” under wallet actions. You can specify the token, the minimum and maximum staking time and amount, as well as the yearly interest and bonus rate. After you create the pool, deposit reward tokens to it so that other users can lock tokens and receive rewards once their staking claim unlocks.

## Intro
Staking pools allow creators to reward holders for locking (staking) their tokens for a definite period. After the period passes, the participant can unlock their staked tokens and receive an additional reward from the deposited rewards, based on the specified yearly interest rate and yearly interest bonus.

*Use Case: Rewarding holders of a fungible token with a certain APY and bonus rate for committing their holding by locking tokens*

## Functionality
A creator creates a staking pool with a specific yearly APY rate and an optional bonus percentage. Optionally, a minimum/maximum amount and locking time may be set. After the pool is created, the creator deposits tokens as reward payouts. Any holder of the pool token can lock and commit their tokens for a reward payout based on staking time and APY, and bonus rate. Once the staking period passes, the participant can unlock their tokens and receive their initial stake, including the interest rate as defined by the pool.
