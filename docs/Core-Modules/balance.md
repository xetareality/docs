So, what is a balance on Xeta? A balance on Xeta represents an amount of fungible tokens that an address holds. Balances are debited and credited when someone makes a transfer with a fungible token. When you transfer a token amount to another address, your token balance will be debited, while their token balance will be credited, or vice versa if they send tokens to you.
